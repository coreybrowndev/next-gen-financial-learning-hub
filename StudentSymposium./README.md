I had a great time at the Symposium. I enjoyed talking to the students and professors about our project. My favorite part was describing our project to people that didn't understand coding and how they found it fascinating. I also found it really fun looking at various projects around me, especially ones that were from complete different fields. Overall, it was a great and insightful expreince.
